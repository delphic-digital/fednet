This site contains the guidelines and best practices for the front-end web development team at Delphic.

The primary motivation is two-fold: 1) code consistency and 2) best practices. By maintaining consistency in coding styles and conventions, we can ease the burden of legacy code maintenance, and mitigate risk of breakage in the future. By adhering to best practices, we ensure optimized page loading, performance and maintainable code.

**Pillars of Front-end Development**

* Markup should be well-formed, semantically correct and generally valid
* Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for presentation
* JavaScript for behavior and interaction

When at all possible, we strive for a [progressive enhancement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement) strategy.

## Approved Properties

All properties defined in CSS 2.1 may be used. Additionally, well-supported properties from CSS3 specifications that are in candidate recommendation status may be used; consult http://caniuse.com/ and the front-end development team leads if unsure.

If vendor-specific prefixes (-moz, -webkit, and -ms) must be used to provide better styling coverage, be sure to specify the prefixed property before the standard property.

New sites will use the HTML5 doctype:
<!DOCTYPE html>

## Format and Style
All elements and attributes must be written in lowercase characters; attribute values must be contained in double quotes; and all tags must be closed. Insert a single space between the last attribute and the trailing slash in a self-closing tag.

Example:
```
<img src="site-logo.png" alt="Site Logo" />
```
